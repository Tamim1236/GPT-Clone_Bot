# GPT-Clone_Bot
- Currently have implemented a very basic chatbot that clones the text-davinci-003 model using the OpenAI API.
- Future plans:
  - Looking to expand project by creating a better UI for users to interact with and eventually turn this into a proper website/application.
  - Update application from using OpenAI's text-davinci-003 model to their ChatGPT model, when it is available on their API.
  - Planning to build text-to-speech model where the answers generated are read out for users.
  - Planning to expand and build a full speech-to-speech model that allows users to interact with the chatbot more naturally by directly asking as opposed to typing.
